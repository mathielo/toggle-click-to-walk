#Toggle Click to Walk - Don't Starve Together

Grants the player the ability to toggle between enable / disable click to walk functionality in-game. 

Disabling the click to move will ONLY affect clicks “on the ground” - e.g. when you’re not targeting any entities. You can still click to perform any actions such as mining, picking, attacking, examining, etc. 

# Options

![Mod Config Panel](./screenshots/mod-config.png)

## Click to Walk

 Tells whether click to walk will be working or not by default when joining a game . Available options:

    Yes | No

## Toggle Key

 Toggles the functionality in-game. Available options:

    K | L | ; | [ | ] | "Disabled"

You can chose to disable the ability to toggle if you like.

# Version Support

Currently only **Don't Starve Together** is supported.

Support for Don't Starve / Reign of Giants / Shipwrecked coming soon.

# Motivation

This mod was inspired by The Forge event when a lot of people seemed interested in this functionality. Although the event is over, it looks like some players don’t like this at all, even on regular DS/DST.  

Hope this mod can help improving your gameplay experience. As always any feedback is appreciated, enjoy!
